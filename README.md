# Volleyball Scoreboard description and inspiration

As the description says, I play in a recreational volleyball league in my spare time and my league didn't have a score board. So I made my own using the angular framework as my frontend framework of choice. If you don't have angular or any of the required software to run this I will include installation instructions below.

# Required Software

To run this you need to have the following software installed: 

-  [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
-  [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Setting up the scoreboard

To set up the scoreboard, first you need to download the git repo. You can either download the zip file and download it in the same folder where you store your visual studio code projects. As seen below.

Or you can copy the web address of this repo and clone the git repo in the same folder mentioned earlier using either the command terminal or your IDE of choice. For this I'm using Visual Studio code.
